# cloud-resume

This repository holds code for my attempt at the Cloud Resume Challenge. Many of the steps of the challenge have costs like "essentially nothing" or "close to free". I wanted to attempt the challenge using only free-tier resources from cloud service providers.

The resume itself is in the form of HTML+CSS documents. When changes to the resume are pushed to the main branch of this repo, it is published to GitHub pages.
