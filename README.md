# cloud-resume

This repository holds code for my attempt at the Cloud Resume Challenge. Many of the steps of the challenge have costs like "essentially nothing" or "close to free". I wanted to attempt the challenge using free-tier resources from cloud service providers (with the sole exception of a custom domain).

The resume itself is in the form of HTML+CSS documents. When changes to the resume are pushed to the main branch of this repo, it is published to CloudFlare pages.
